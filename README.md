# ProgrammingProject
 A dataset simulated by a real-world phenomenon, please find the full project in ![Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/MartynaMisk/ProgrammingProject/blob/master/RealwolrdPhenomenon.ipynb)
 
 ## Main area of focus:
 1. Research on how to build a Dataset using pandas Dataframe
 2. Research aspects on what wil I base the Dataset
 3. Explain the relevance of the variables to eachother
 
 ## Libraries used
 - Numpy
 - Seaborn 
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 
 ## Explanation of Dataset
Dataset demonstrate a sale of 20% on four different type of shoes and amount that is available during this sale. I have collected one-hundred data points across six diï¬€erent variables. Those variables include: shoe size, shoe type, original prize, price of 20% dicount, sale price, and shoe type avaialble.
